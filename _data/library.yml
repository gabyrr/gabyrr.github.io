- abstract: Crosslingual text classification consists of exploiting
    labeled documents in a source language to classify documents in a
    different target language. In addition to the evident translation
    problem, this task also faces some difficulties caused by the
    cultural discrepancies manifested in both languages by means of
    different topic distributions. Such discrepancies make the
    classifier unreliable for the categorization task. In order to
    tackle this problem we propose to improve the classification
    performance by using information embedded in the own target dataset.
    The central idea of the proposed approach is that similar documents
    must belong to the same category. Therefore, it classifies the
    documents by considering not only their own content but also
    information about the assigned category to other similar documents
    from the same target dataset. Experimental results using three
    different languages evidence the appropriateness of the proposed
    approach.

- abstract: During the last decades the Web has become the greatest
    repository of digital information. In order to organize all this
    information, several text categorization methods have been
    developed, achieving accurate results in most cases and in very
    different domains. Due to the recent usage of Internet as
    communication media, short texts such as news, tweets, blogs, and
    product reviews are more common every day. In this context, there
    are two main challenges; on the one hand, the length of these
    documents is short, and therefore, the word frequencies are not
    informative enough, making text categorization even more difficult
    than usual. On the other hand, topics are changing constantly at a
    fast rate, causing the lack of adequate amounts of training data. In
    order to deal with these two problems we consider a text
    classification method that is supported on the idea that similar
    documents may belong to the same category. Mainly, we propose a
    neighborhood consensus classification method that classifies
    documents by considering their own information as well as
    information about the category assigned to other similar documents
    from the same target collection. In particular, the short texts we
    used in our evaluation are news titles with an average of 8 words.
    Experimental results are encouraging; they indicate that leveraging
    information from similar documents helped to improve classification
    accuracy and that the proposed method is especially useful when
    labeled training resources are limited.

- abstract: Current text classification methods are mostly based on a
    supervised approach, which require a large number of examples to
    build models accurate. Unfortunately, in several tasks training sets
    are extremely small and their generation is very expensive. In order
    to tackle this problem in this paper we propose a new text
    classification method that takes advantage of the information
    embedded in the own test set. This method is supported on the idea
    that similar documents must belong to the same category.
    Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering not only
    their own content but also information about the assigned category
    to other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental
    results in four data sets of different sizes are encouraging. They
    indicate that the proposed method is appropriate to be used with
    small training sets, where it could significantly outperform the
    results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support
    Vector Machines.

- abstract: "Classifying malware into correct families is an important
    task for anti-virus vendors. Currently, only some of them will
    recognize a particular malware. Even when they do, they either
    classify them into different families or use a generic family name,
    which does not provide much information. Our method for malware
    family identification is based on the observation that closely
    related malware have heavy overlap of strings. We first created two
    kinds of prototypes from printable strings in the malware: one using
    term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and the other
    using the prominent strings extracted from the vocabulary. We then
    used these prototypes for classification. We achieved an accuracy of
    91.02 % by considering the entire vocabulary and an accuracy of
    80.52 % by considering 20 prominent strings for each malware family.
    Our accuracy is high enough for our system to be used to classify
    even those malware that can confuse the anti-virus vendors."

- abstract: Online communities are filled with comments of loyal readers
    or first-time viewers, that are constantly creating and sharing
    information at an unprecedented level, resulting in millions of
    messages containing opinions, ideas, needs and beliefs of Internet
    users. Therefore, businesses companies are very interested in
    finding influential users and encouraging them to create positive
    influence. Influential users represent users with the ability to
    influence individual's attitudes in a desired way with relative
    frequency. We present an empirical analysis on influential users
    identification problem in Twitter. Our proposed approach considers
    that the influential level of users can be detected by considering
    its communication patterns, by means of particular writing style
    features as well as behavioral features. Performed experiments on
    more that 7000 users profiles, indicate that it is possible to
    automatically identify influential users among the members of a
    social networking community, and also it obtains competitive results
    against several state-of-the-art methods.
