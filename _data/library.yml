  abstract: During the last decades the Web has become the greatest repository of
    digital information. In order to organize all this information, several text categorization
    methods have been developed, achieving accurate results in most cases and in very
    different domains. Due to the recent usage of Internet as communication media,
    short texts such as news, tweets, blogs, and product reviews are more common every
    day. In this context, there are two main challenges; on the one hand, the length
    of these documents is short, and therefore, the word frequencies are not informative
    enough, making text categorization even more difficult than usual. On the other
    hand, topics are changing constantly at a fast rate, causing the lack of adequate
    amounts of training data. In order to deal with these two problems we consider
    a text classification method that is supported on the idea that similar documents
    may belong to the same category. Mainly, we propose a neighborhood consensus classification
    method that classifies documents by considering their own information as well
    as information about the category assigned to other similar documents from the
    same target collection. In particular, the short texts we used in our evaluation
    are news titles with an average of 8 words. Experimental results are encouraging;
    they indicate that leveraging information from similar documents helped to improve
    classification accuracy and that the proposed method is especially useful when
    labeled training resources are limited.
