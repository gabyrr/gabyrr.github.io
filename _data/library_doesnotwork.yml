  abstract: Crosslingual text classification consists of exploiting labeled documents
    in a source language to classify documents in a different target language. In
    addition to the evident translation problem, this task also faces some difficulties
    caused by the cultural discrepancies manifested in both languages by means of
    different topic distributions. Such discrepancies make the classifier unreliable
    for the categorization task. In order to tackle this problem we propose to improve
    the classification performance by using information embedded in the own target
    dataset. The central idea of the proposed approach is that similar documents must
    belong to the same category. Therefore, it classifies the documents by considering
    not only their own content but also information about the assigned category to
    other similar documents from the same target dataset. Experimental results using
    three different languages evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approach.

  abstract: During the last decades the Web has become the greatest repository of
    digital information. In order to organize all this information, several text categorization
    methods have been developed, achieving accurate results in most cases and in very
    different domains. Due to the recent usage of Internet as communication media,
    short texts such as news, tweets, blogs, and product reviews are more common every
    day. In this context, there are two main challenges; on the one hand, the length
    of these documents is short, and therefore, the word frequencies are not informative
    enough, making text categorization even more difficult than usual. On the other
    hand, topics are changing constantly at a fast rate, causing the lack of adequate
    amounts of training data. In order to deal with these two problems we consider
    a text classification method that is supported on the idea that similar documents
    may belong to the same category. Mainly, we propose a neighborhood consensus classification
    method that classifies documents by considering their own information as well
    as information about the category assigned to other similar documents from the
    same target collection. In particular, the short texts we used in our evaluation
    are news titles with an average of 8 words. Experimental results are encouraging;
    they indicate that leveraging information from similar documents helped to improve
    classification accuracy and that the proposed method is especially useful when
    labeled training resources are limited.

  abstract: Current text classification methods are mostly based on a supervised approach,
    which require a large number of examples to build models accurate. Unfortunately,
    in several tasks training sets are extremely small and their generation is very
    expensive. In order to tackle this problem in this paper we propose a new text
    classification method that takes advantage of the information embedded in the
    own test set. This method is supported on the idea that similar documents must
    belong to the same category. Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering
    not only their own content but also information about the assigned category to
    other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental results in four data
    sets of different sizes are encouraging. They indicate that the proposed method
    is appropriate to be used with small training sets, where it could significantly
    outperform the results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support
    Vector Machines.

  abstract: "Classifying malware into correct families is an important task for anti-virus\
    \ vendors. Currently, only some of them will recognize a particular malware. Even\
    \ when they do, they either classify them into different families or use a generic\
    \ family name, which does not provide much information. Our method for malware\
    \ family identification is based on the observation that closely related malware\
    \ have heavy overlap of strings. We first created two kinds of prototypes from\
    \ printable strings in the malware: one using term frequency\u2013inverse document\
    \ frequency (tf-idf) and the other using the prominent strings extracted from\
    \ the vocabulary. We then used these prototypes for classification. We achieved\
    \ an accuracy of 91.02\_% by considering the entire vocabulary and an accuracy\
    \ of 80.52\_% by considering 20 prominent strings for each malware family. Our\
    \ accuracy is high enough for our system to be used to classify even those malware\
    \ that can confuse the anti-virus vendors."

  abstract: "Online communities are filled with comments of loyal readers or first-time\
    \ viewers, that are constantly creating and sharing information at an unprecedented\
    \ level, resulting in millions of messages containing opinions, ideas, needs and\
    \ beliefs of Internet users. Therefore, businesses companies are very interested\
    \ in finding influential users and encouraging them to create positive influence.\
    \ Influential users represent users with the ability to influence individual\u2019\
    s attitudes in a desired way with relative frequency. We present an empirical\
    \ analysis on influential users identification problem in Twitter. Our proposed\
    \ approach considers that the influential level of users can be detected by considering\
    \ its communication patterns, by means of particular writing style features as\
    \ well as behavioral features. Performed experiments on more that 7000 users profiles,\
    \ indicate that it is possible to automatically identify influential users among\
    \ the members of a social networking community, and also it obtains competitive\
    \ results against several state-of-the-art methods."

  abstract: "A conversational agent, also known as chatbot, is a machine conversational\
    \ system which interacts with human users via natural language. Traditionally,\
    \ chatbot technology is built under certain set of \u201Cmanually\u201D elaborated\
    \ conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples\
    \ of humans\u2019 interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules\
    \ is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for\
    \ building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality\
    \ and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot\
    \ we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia.\
    \ Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to\
    \ elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager\
    \ would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large\
    \ dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers."

  abstract: The vast amount of electronic documents available on the Internet demands
    for automatic tools that help people finding, organizing and easily accessing
    to all this information. Although current text classification methods have alleviated
    some of the above problems, such strategies depend on having a large and reliable
    set of labeled data. In order to overcome such limitation, this work proposes
    an alternative approach for semi-supervised text classification, which is based
    on a new strategy for diminishing the sensitivity to the noise contained on labeled
    data by means of automatic text summarization. Experimental results showed that
    our proposed approach outperforms traditional semi-supervised text classification
    techniques; additionally, our results also indicate that our approach is suitable
    for learning from only one labeled example per category.

  abstract: Automatic detection of source code plagiarism is an important research
    field for both the commercial software industry and within the research community.
    Existing methods of plagiarism detection primarily involve exhaustive pairwise
    document comparison, which does not scale well for large software collections.
    To achieve scalability, we approach the problem from an information retrieval
    (IR) perspective. We retrieve a ranked list of candidate documents in response
    to a pseudo-query representation constructed from each source code document in
    the collection. The challenge in source code document retrieval is that the standard
    bag-of-words (BoW) representation model for such documents is likely to result
    in many false positives being retrieved, because of the use of identical programming
    language specific constructs and keywords. To address this problem, we make use
    of an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the source code documents.
    While the IR approach is efficient, it is essentially unsupervised in nature.
    To further improve its effectiveness, we apply a supervised classifier (pre-trained
    with features extracted from sample plagiarized source code pairs) on the top
    ranked retrieved documents. We report experiments on the SOCO-2014 dataset comprising
    12K Java source files with almost 1M lines of code. Our experiments confirm that
    the AST based approach produces significantly better retrieval effectiveness than
    a standard BoW representation, i.e., the AST based approach is able to identify
    a higher number of plagiarized source code documents at top ranks in response
    to a query source code document. The supervised classifier, trained on features
    extracted from sample plagiarized source code pairs, is shown to effectively filter
    and thus further improve the ranked list of retrieved candidate plagiarized documents.

  abstract: Progress in the autonomous analysis of human behavior from multimodal
    information has lead to very effective methods able to deal with problems like
    action/gesture/activity recognition, pose estimation, opinion mining, user tailored
    retrieval, etc. However, it is only recently that the community has been starting
    to look into related problems associated with more complex behavior, including
    personality analysis, deception detection, among others. We organized an academic
    contest co-located with ICPR2018 running two tasks in this direction. On the one
    hand, we organized an information fusion task in the context of multimodal image
    retrieval in social media. On the other hand, we ran another task in which we
    aim to infer personality traits from written essays, including textual and handwritten
    information. This paper describes both tasks, detailing for each of them the associated
    problem, data sets, evaluation metrics and protocol, as well as an analysis of
    the performance of simple baselines.

  abstract: This project researches if critical reception facing YouTube content can
    be promoted in children between nine and eleven years old, focusing in analysis,
    evaluation and taking a stand facing the videos of risky challenges. This is an
    interdisciplinary project that used a mixed methodology, mostly quantitative which
    consists in four phases, two of them will be exposed in this paper. One phase
    let us know what the kids like and consume. The other phase allow us to measure
    the level of three abilities of critical thinking. We found that even if the kids
    do not consume a lot of channels with risky challenges, it is important to enhance
    the ability to take a stand in order to avoid that children hurt themselves.

    \ that can lead to tragic outcomes. In this paper, we propose a method for using\
    \ an approximation to a mental lexicon to model the communication process of depressed\
    \ and non-depressed participants in spontaneous North American English clinical\
    \ interviews. Our approach, inspired by the Lexical Availability theory, identifies\
    \ the most relevant vocabulary of the interviewed participant, and use it as features\
    \ in a classification process. We performed an in-depth evaluation on the DAIC-WOZ\
    \ [20] and the E-DAIC [11] clinical datasets. Obtained results indicate that our\
    \ approach can compete against recent contextual embeddings when modeling and\
    \ identifying depression. We show the generalization capabilities of our algorithm\
    \ using outside data, reaching a macro F1 = 0.83 and F1 = 0.80 in the DAIC-WOZ\
    \ and E-DAIC datasets respectively. An analysis of our method\u2019s interpretability\
    \ allows understanding how the classifier is making its decisions. During this\
    \ process, we observed strong connections between our obtained results and previous\
    \ research from the psychological field."
