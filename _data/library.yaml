- abstract: Crosslingual text classification consists of exploiting
    labeled documents in a source language to classify documents in a
    different target language. In addition to the evident translation
    problem, this task also faces some difficulties caused by the
    cultural discrepancies manifested in both languages by means of
    different topic distributions. Such discrepancies make the
    classifier unreliable for the categorization task. In order to
    tackle this problem we propose to improve the classification
    performance by using information embedded in the own target dataset.
    The central idea of the proposed approach is that similar documents
    must belong to the same category. Therefore, it classifies the
    documents by considering not only their own content but also
    information about the assigned category to other similar documents
    from the same target dataset. Experimental results using three
    different languages evidence the appropriateness of the proposed
    approach.

- abstract: During the last decades the Web has become the greatest
    repository of digital information. In order to organize all this
    information, several text categorization methods have been
    developed, achieving accurate results in most cases and in very
    different domains. Due to the recent usage of Internet as
    communication media, short texts such as news, tweets, blogs, and
    product reviews are more common every day. In this context, there
    are two main challenges; on the one hand, the length of these
    documents is short, and therefore, the word frequencies are not
    informative enough, making text categorization even more difficult
    than usual. On the other hand, topics are changing constantly at a
    fast rate, causing the lack of adequate amounts of training data. In
    order to deal with these two problems we consider a text
    classification method that is supported on the idea that similar
    documents may belong to the same category. Mainly, we propose a
    neighborhood consensus classification method that classifies
    documents by considering their own information as well as
    information about the category assigned to other similar documents
    from the same target collection. In particular, the short texts we
    used in our evaluation are news titles with an average of 8 words.
    Experimental results are encouraging; they indicate that leveraging
    information from similar documents helped to improve classification
    accuracy and that the proposed method is especially useful when
    labeled training resources are limited.

- abstract: Current text classification methods are mostly based on a
    supervised approach, which require a large number of examples to
    build models accurate. Unfortunately, in several tasks training sets
    are extremely small and their generation is very expensive. In order
    to tackle this problem in this paper we propose a new text
    classification method that takes advantage of the information
    embedded in the own test set. This method is supported on the idea
    that similar documents must belong to the same category.
    Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering not only
    their own content but also information about the assigned category
    to other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental
    results in four data sets of different sizes are encouraging. They
    indicate that the proposed method is appropriate to be used with
    small training sets, where it could significantly outperform the
    results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support
    Vector Machines.

- abstract: "Classifying malware into correct families is an important
    task for anti-virus vendors. Currently, only some of them will
    recognize a particular malware. Even when they do, they either
    classify them into different families or use a generic family name,
    which does not provide much information. Our method for malware
    family identification is based on the observation that closely
    related malware have heavy overlap of strings. We first created two
    kinds of prototypes from printable strings in the malware: one using
    term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and the other
    using the prominent strings extracted from the vocabulary. We then
    used these prototypes for classification. We achieved an accuracy of
    91.02 % by considering the entire vocabulary and an accuracy of
    80.52 % by considering 20 prominent strings for each malware family.
    Our accuracy is high enough for our system to be used to classify
    even those malware that can confuse the anti-virus vendors."

- abstract: Online communities are filled with comments of loyal readers
    or first-time viewers, that are constantly creating and sharing
    information at an unprecedented level, resulting in millions of
    messages containing opinions, ideas, needs and beliefs of Internet
    users. Therefore, businesses companies are very interested in
    finding influential users and encouraging them to create positive
    influence. Influential users represent users with the ability to
    influence individual's attitudes in a desired way with relative
    frequency. We present an empirical analysis on influential users
    identification problem in Twitter. Our proposed approach considers
    that the influential level of users can be detected by considering
    its communication patterns, by means of particular writing style
    features as well as behavioral features. Performed experiments on
    more that 7000 users profiles, indicate that it is possible to
    automatically identify influential users among the members of a
    social networking community, and also it obtains competitive results
    against several state-of-the-art methods.

- abstract: A conversational agent, also known as chatbot, is a machine
    conversational system which interacts with human users via natural
    language. Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain
    set of "manually" elaborated conversational rules. However, given
    the availability of large and real examples of humans' interactions
    in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more
    feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building
    and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager
    personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means
    of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in
    the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments
    demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate
    comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager
    would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release
    a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations
    among teenagers.

- abstract: The vast amount of electronic documents available on the
    Internet demands for automatic tools that help people finding,
    organizing and easily accessing to all this information. Although
    current text classification methods have alleviated some of the
    above problems, such strategies depend on having a large and
    reliable set of labeled data. In order to overcome such limitation,
    this work proposes an alternative approach for semi-supervised text
    classification, which is based on a new strategy for diminishing the
    sensitivity to the noise contained on labeled data by means of
    automatic text summarization. Experimental results showed that our
    proposed approach outperforms traditional semi-supervised text
    classification techniques; additionally, our results also indicate
    that our approach is suitable for learning from only one labeled
    example per category.

- abstract: Automatic detection of source code plagiarism is an
    important research field for both the commercial software industry
    and within the research community. Existing methods of plagiarism
    detection primarily involve exhaustive pairwise document comparison,
    which does not scale well for large software collections. To achieve
    scalability, we approach the problem from an information retrieval
    (IR) perspective. We retrieve a ranked list of candidate documents
    in response to a pseudo-query representation constructed from each
    source code document in the collection. The challenge in source code
    document retrieval is that the standard bag-of-words (BoW)
    representation model for such documents is likely to result in many
    false positives being retrieved, because of the use of identical
    programming language specific constructs and keywords. To address
    this problem, we make use of an abstract syntax tree (AST)
    representation of the source code documents. While the IR approach
    is efficient, it is essentially unsupervised in nature. To further
    improve its effectiveness, we apply a supervised classifier
    (pre-trained with features extracted from sample plagiarized source
    code pairs) on the top ranked retrieved documents. We report
    experiments on the SOCO-2014 dataset comprising 12K Java source
    files with almost 1M lines of code. Our experiments confirm that the
    AST based approach produces significantly better retrieval
    effectiveness than a standard BoW representation, i.e., the AST
    based approach is able to identify a higher number of plagiarized
    source code documents at top ranks in response to a query source
    code document. The supervised classifier, trained on features
    extracted from sample plagiarized source code pairs, is shown to
    effectively filter and thus further improve the ranked list of
    retrieved candidate plagiarized documents.

- abstract: Progress in the autonomous analysis of human behavior from
    multimodal information has lead to very effective methods able to
    deal with problems like action/gesture/activity recognition, pose
    estimation, opinion mining, user tailored retrieval, etc. However,
    it is only recently that the community has been starting to look
    into related problems associated with more complex behavior,
    including personality analysis, deception detection, among others.
    We organized an academic contest co-located with ICPR2018 running
    two tasks in this direction. On the one hand, we organized an
    information fusion task in the context of multimodal image retrieval
    in social media. On the other hand, we ran another task in which we
    aim to infer personality traits from written essays, including
    textual and handwritten information. This paper describes both
    tasks, detailing for each of them the associated problem, data sets,
    evaluation metrics and protocol, as well as an analysis of the
    performance of simple baselines.

- abstract: This project researches if critical reception facing YouTube
    content can be promoted in children between nine and eleven years
    old, focusing in analysis, evaluation and taking a stand facing the
    videos of risky challenges. This is an interdisciplinary project
    that used a mixed methodology, mostly quantitative which consists in
    four phases, two of them will be exposed in this paper. One phase
    let us know what the kids like and consume. The other phase allow us
    to measure the level of three abilities of critical thinking. We
    found that even if the kids do not consume a lot of channels with
    risky challenges, it is important to enhance the ability to take a
    stand in order to avoid that children hurt themselves.

- abstract: Depression disorder is one of the major causes of disability
    in the world that can lead to tragic outcomes. In this paper, we
    propose a method for using an approximation to a mental lexicon to
    model the communication process of depressed and non-depressed
    participants in spontaneous North American English clinical
    interviews. Our approach, inspired by the Lexical Availability
    theory, identifies the most relevant vocabulary of the interviewed
    participant, and use it as features in a classification process. We
    performed an in-depth evaluation on the DAIC-WOZ \[20\] and the
    E-DAIC \[11\] clinical datasets. Obtained results indicate that our
    approach can compete against recent contextual embeddings when
    modeling and identifying depression. We show the generalization
    capabilities of our algorithm using outside data, reaching a macro
    F1 = 0.83 and F1 = 0.80 in the DAIC-WOZ and E-DAIC datasets
    respectively. An analysis of our method's interpretability allows
    understanding how the classifier is making its decisions. During
    this process, we observed strong connections between our obtained
    results and previous research from the psychological field.
