abstract="Crosslingual text classification consists of exploiting labeled documents in a source language to classify documents in a different target language. In addition to the evident translation problem, this task also faces some difficulties caused by the cultural discrepancies manifested in both languages by means of different topic distributions. Such discrepancies make the classifier unreliable for the categorization task. In order to tackle this problem we propose to improve the classification performance by using information embedded in the own target dataset. The central idea of the proposed approach is that similar documents must belong to the same category. Therefore, it classifies the documents by considering not only their own content but also information about the assigned category to other similar documents from the same target dataset. Experimental results using three different languages evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approach.",

abstract="During the last decades the Web has become the greatest repository of digital information. In order to organize all this information, several text categorization methods have been developed, achieving accurate results in most cases and in very different domains. Due to the recent usage of Internet as communication media, short texts such as news, tweets, blogs, and product reviews are more common every day. In this context, there are two main challenges; on the one hand, the length of these documents is short, and therefore, the word frequencies are not informative enough, making text categorization even more difficult than usual. On the other hand, topics are changing constantly at a fast rate, causing the lack of adequate amounts of training data. In order to deal with these two problems we consider a text classification method that is supported on the idea that similar documents may belong to the same category. Mainly, we propose a neighborhood consensus classification method that classifies documents by considering their own information as well as information about the category assigned to other similar documents from the same target collection. In particular, the short texts we used in our evaluation are news titles with an average of 8 words. Experimental results are encouraging; they indicate that leveraging information from similar documents helped to improve classification accuracy and that the proposed method is especially useful when labeled training resources are limited.",

abstract="Current text classification methods are mostly based on a supervised approach, which require a large number of examples to build models accurate. Unfortunately, in several tasks training sets are extremely small and their generation is very expensive. In order to tackle this problem in this paper we propose a new text classification method that takes advantage of the information embedded in the own test set. This method is supported on the idea that similar documents must belong to the same category. Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering not only their own content but also information about the assigned category to other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental results in four data sets of different sizes are encouraging. They indicate that the proposed method is appropriate to be used with small training sets, where it could significantly outperform the results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.",

abstract="Classifying malware into correct families is an important task for anti-virus vendors. Currently, only some of them will recognize a particular malware. Even when they do, they either classify them into different families or use a generic family name, which does not provide much information. Our method for malware family identification is based on the observation that closely related malware have heavy overlap of strings. We first created two kinds of prototypes from printable strings in the malware: one using term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and the other using the prominent strings extracted from the vocabulary. We then used these prototypes for classification. We achieved an accuracy of 91.02 {\%} by considering the entire vocabulary and an accuracy of 80.52 {\%} by considering 20 prominent strings for each malware family. Our accuracy is high enough for our system to be used to classify even those malware that can confuse the anti-virus vendors.",

abstract="Online communities are filled with comments of loyal readers or first-time viewers, that are constantly creating and sharing information at an unprecedented level, resulting in millions of messages containing opinions, ideas, needs and beliefs of Internet users. Therefore, businesses companies are very interested in finding influential users and encouraging them to create positive influence. Influential users represent users with the ability to influence individual's attitudes in a desired way with relative frequency. We present an empirical analysis on influential users identification problem in Twitter. Our proposed approach considers that the influential level of users can be detected by considering its communication patterns, by means of particular writing style features as well as behavioral features. Performed experiments on more that 7000 users profiles, indicate that it is possible to automatically identify influential users among the members of a social networking community, and also it obtains competitive results against several state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract="A conversational agent, also known as chatbot, is a machine conversational system which interacts with human users via natural language. Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of ``manually'' elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans' interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers.",

In order to overcome such limitation, this work proposes an alternative approach for semi-supervised text classification, which is based on a new strategy for diminishing the sensitivity to the noise contained on labeled data by means of automatic text summarization. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach outperforms traditional semi-supervised text classification techniques; additionally, our results also indicate that our approach is suitable for learning from only one labeled example per category.",

Existing methods of plagiarism detection primarily involve exhaustive pairwise document comparison, which does not scale well for large software collections.

We retrieve a ranked list of candidate documents in response to a pseudo-query representation constructed from each source code document in the collection. The challenge in source code document retrieval is that the standard bag-of-words (BoW) representation model for such documents is likely to result in many false positives being retrieved, because of the use of identical programming language specific constructs and keywords. To address this problem, we make use of an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the source code documents. While the IR approach is efficient, it is essentially unsupervised in nature. To further improve its effectiveness, we apply a supervised classifier (pre-trained with features extracted from sample plagiarized source code pairs) on the top ranked retrieved documents. We report experiments on the SOCO-2014 dataset comprising 12K Java source files with almost 1M lines of code. Our experiments confirm that the AST based approach produces significantly better retrieval effectiveness than a standard BoW representation, i.e., the AST based approach is able to identify a higher number of plagiarized source code documents at top ranks in response to a query source code document. The supervised classifier, trained on features extracted from sample plagiarized source code pairs, is shown to effectively filter and thus further improve the ranked list of retrieved candidate plagiarized documents.",

abstract="Progress in the autonomous analysis of human behavior from multimodal information has lead to very effective methods able to deal with problems like action/gesture/activity recognition, pose estimation, opinion mining, user tailored retrieval, etc. However, it is only recently that the community has been starting to look into related problems associated with more complex behavior, including personality analysis, deception detection, among others. We organized an academic contest co-located with ICPR2018 running two tasks in this direction. On the one hand, we organized an information fusion task in the context of multimodal image retrieval in social media. On the other hand, we ran another task in which we aim to infer personality traits from written essays, including textual and handwritten information. This paper describes both tasks, detailing for each of them the associated problem, data sets, evaluation metrics and protocol, as well as an analysis of the performance of simple baselines.",

This is an interdisciplinary project that used a mixed methodology, mostly quantitative which consists in four phases, two of them will be exposed in this paper. One phase let us know what the kids like and consume. The other phase allow us to measure the level of three abilities of critical thinking. We found that even if the kids do not consume a lot of channels with risky challenges, it is important to enhance the ability to take a stand in order to avoid that children hurt themselves.",

abstract = {Depression disorder is one of the major causes of disability in the world that can lead to tragic outcomes. In this paper, we propose a method for using an approximation to a mental lexicon to model the communication process of depressed and non-depressed participants in spontaneous North American English clinical interviews. Our approach, inspired by the Lexical Availability theory, identifies the most relevant vocabulary of the interviewed participant, and use it as features in a classification process. We performed an in-depth evaluation on the DAIC-WOZ [20] and the E-DAIC [11] clinical datasets. Obtained results indicate that our approach can compete against recent contextual embeddings when modeling and identifying depression. We show the generalization capabilities of our algorithm using outside data, reaching a macro F1 = 0.83 and F1 = 0.80 in the DAIC-WOZ and E-DAIC datasets respectively. An analysis of our method’s interpretability allows understanding how the classifier is making its decisions. During this process, we observed strong connections between our obtained results and previous research from the psychological field.},
