![announce](/assets/images/other/LXAI-logo-black.png){: .align-left} **Comming up**. I'll be presenting my work _Mental lexicon for personality identification in texts_ in [2019 LXAI Research Workshop @ Neurips](https://www.latinxinai.org/neurips-2019) this December 9th in Vancouver, Canada.

{: .text-left .notice--success}

I'm a researcher/teacher at [Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) Cuajimalpa](http://www.cua.uam.mx/)) in the Information Technology Department. I work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area. My current research interests are in the intersection of NLP and Social Sciences (particularly, Psycology). Broadly, I'm interested in developing methods and new  representations for texts to help in diagnosis of mental illnesses. For instance, I work in author profiling problems, such as personality identification, and depression and anorexia identification from texts.

I'm a member of the [Language and Rasoning Research Group ](http://lyr.cua.uam.mx/)) at UAM-Cuajimalpa since 2013. I'm an external member of the Laboratory on Language Technologies [LabTL](https://ccc.inaoep.mx/laboratorios/labtl.php) of the Computational Sciences Department at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE) Mexico since 2008. I'm also member of the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence SMIA, the Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing [AMPLN](http://ampln.mx/portal/inicio), and the Language Technologies Thematic Network [RedTTL](http://redttl.mx/).
