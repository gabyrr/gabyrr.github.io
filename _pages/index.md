I'm a researcher/teacher at [Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) Cuajimalpa](http://www.cua.uam.mx/)) in the Information Technology Department. I work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area. My actual research interests are in the intersection of NLP and Social Sciences (particularly, Psycology). Broadly, I'm interested in developing methods and new  representations for texts to help in diagnosis pf mental illnesses. For instance, I work in several tasks of author profiling: personality identification, and depression and anorexia identification from texts. I think that the simpler the representation or method the better.

I'm a member of the [Language and Rasoning Research Group ](http://lyr.cua.uam.mx/)) at UAM-Cuajimalpa since 2013. I'm an external member of the Laboratory on Language Technologies of the Computational Sciences Department at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE) Mexico since 2008. I'm also member of the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence SMIA, the Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing (AMPLN), and the Language Technologies Thematic Network RedTTL.
