I'm a researcher/professor at Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) Cuajimalpa, working in the Information Technology Department. I work in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) area. My research interests in this area include: Methods and representation for author profiling, automatic approaches for plagiarism detection in source code, and supervised methods for text categorization. Also, I'm interested in problems such as automatic summarization, sentiment analysis and authorship attribution.

I'm member of the Language and Rasoning Research Group at UAM-C since 2013. I'm an external member of the Laboratory on Language Technologies of the Computational Sciences Department at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE) Mexico since 2008. I'm also member of the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence SMIA, the Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing (AMPLN), and the Language Technologies Thematic Network RedTTL.
